# kottans-frontend
Repository for Kottans' frontend course 

## Git, GitHub, git flow

- Refreshed knowledge on basic git commands/git flow/branches and merging
- Learned about git request (haven’t thought about it previously))
- I certainly will use basic git commands like git clone, git add/commit/pull/push/merge, and etc in the future. Basically, I’m already using them.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

### Linux Survival

Refreshed knowledge on Linux terminal basic commands. I use them on daily basis, so didn’t find something groundbreaking. but I was really surprised to know “ps aux | grep name” will show the process of grep itself. Was wondering for the long time, why grep shows me two processes, instead of one.

Will definitely use the Linux terminal in the future. Mostly, it’s much faster than GUI and gives more flexibility. Not to mention how people are surprised to see I’m doing something in the bash and saying: “Are you a hacker?”.

### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1 and Part 2

- Refreshed knowledge on URLs, HTTP requests/response.
- Get acquitted with new for me verbs/status codes and message formats.
- Discovered tools for viewing HTTP traffic and some basics of using HTTP with Node, Ruby on Rails and jQuery Ajax
- Discovered the basics of identification and authentication processes via HTTP, including HTTPS. Learnt basic principles of certificates, HTTP Caching, cache processing and controlling.

I do believe the understanding of the HTTP basics will help me to build more resilient and user-friendly websites/apps. Moreover, I do think it will help me in the building of server parts, not just a frontend.


## Git Collaboration

- Learnt how to synchronize local and remote repos and deepened knowledge on branching
- There was quite a lot of new things to me, but I will single out the operations with arguments for fetch and push
- Also, “source of nothing” just blown my mind but think it’ll need time and practice to get used to this technique
- Will use most of the commands from this course for sure, including forking, merging, synchronizing with remotes, pushing/pulling commits.
