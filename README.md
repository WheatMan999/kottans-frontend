Repository for completing the frontend course from Kottan

# Git, GitHub, git flow

- Refreshed knowledge on basic git commands/git flow/branches and merging
- Learned about git request (haven’t thought about it previously))
- I certainly will use basic git commands like git clone, git add/commit/pull/push/merge, and etc in the future. Basically, I’m already using them.
